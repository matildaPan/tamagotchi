# tamagotchi

The Tamagotchi (たまごっち, IPA: [tamaɡotꜜtɕi]) is a handheld digital pet that was created in Japan

My version of Tamagotchi:
 - it can digest, poop, sleep and wake up on its own.
 - you need to clean the pop and feed it.
 - it will loose its health if poop is not cleaned or stomach is empty
 - it will improve its health if you clean its poop and feed it

Its health is on you now ! 

In addition, it also age by itself just like us.
